Assignment on in The Odin Project Curriculum

I was able to complete the project with ease.

I learnt that:
- The <p> will put everything on the online, so I used multiple <p> tags.
- Lists make things look so much more organised. Huge return on small effort.
- Img sources need to be all on one line (I think)
