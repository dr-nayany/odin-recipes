    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices,</p>
    <p>then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home.</p>
    <p>Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the</p>
    <p>cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of cut chicken pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1.25 cups of plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>0.5 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat </p>
        <p>and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with</p>
        <p>lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</p></li>

        <li><p>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food colouring.</p>
        <p>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours</p></li>

        <li><p>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat</p>
        <p>and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard</p>
        <p>remaining marinade.</p></li>

        <li><p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices</p>
        <p>run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should</p>
        <p>read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro.</p></li>

    </ol>
